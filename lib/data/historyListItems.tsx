        <p>After years of playing MOBAs, it was time to get back into a MMORPG however the Maplestory era was over, at least for me.</p>
        <p>
          A big portion of my time was spent researching MMORPGs (including the non-popular ones) to find out what combat style the game had, the leveling system, graphics including the fluidity of the animations, 
          and mechanics such as partying and guilds.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this period, my motivation of playing MMORPGs were heavily influenced by the anime, Sword Art Online, and out of all the games that were on the list, Dragon Nest was the game that 
          satisfied most of my conditions. There were a few honorable mentions such as Tera and Guild Wars 2, however the combat system of those games were just too slow and bland.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, Dragon Nest's skill to skill transition fludity was smooth enough to think that they meant to be used as combos, 
          whereas the majority of MMORPGs skill to skill transition fluidity were very rigid and the players would experience a small pause between each skill.
          This made the PVP system incredibly enjoyable regardless of whether it was single PVP or group PVP.
        </p>
        <p>The early phases of the game was a completely new experience. Leveling/grinding, gearing and doing quests was generally simple and could be accomplished by following the main questline.</p>
        <p>
          The learning curve was comparatively better/easier than playing with an experienced player due to the fact that the party system was able to "cap" your level within a day, 
          however once you knew the game, it was definitely better to level up an alternative character using the party system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many RPGs, the combat system included invincibility frames (I-frames) in the base tumble/dodge skill for every class, 
          but Dragon Nest also included i-frames within skills for a few classes which allowed players to damage monsters while the monster is attacking if timed correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          As cliche as it may sound, I joined a decent guild which helped me progress further through the game such as nests (4 man) and raids (6 ~ 8 man).
          Just like in any community, conflict within the guild was inevitable. 
          Connections were cut and friendships were broken but at the end of the day, there were many memorable moments we shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a short hiatus, I was able to join another guild with the help of a friend from the previous guild. 
          This guild was more like a family than just some online friends from a game. I still treasure these people yet to this day and will not forget the great time we had.
        </p>
        <p>
          The raids of this game were always such a mission, due to the difficulty compared to the level cap and the number of mechanics and skills that had to be memorised. 
          Each raid consisted of 5-6 mini bosses and 1 final boss. Few bosses had a mechanic where if 1 member didn't do it correctly, it would wipe out the whole party. 
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, clearing the raids dropped top tier equipments for a random class which then would be given to the players of that class, 
          or if the class wasn't in the party, the equipment would get sold and the gold would be evenly distributed to each member.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the game slowly died due to the greediness of the game developer/publisher, 
          Dragon Nest is still considered my favourite game of all time and would play again if I could go back in time.

          Forgot to mention, I only played the <span className="shadow" style={{ color: '#ED4A4A' }}>Swordsman</span> specialisation of the <span className="shadow" style={{ color: '#ED4A4A' }}>Warrior</span> class.

    body:
      <>
        <p>As the population of the OCE DotA community started to decrease, I happened to stumble upon a new MOBA game, League of Legends.</p>
        <p>
          At first glance, compared to the graphics of Warcraft III, it was an upgrade/improvement however the dark feeling that DotA had was gone.
          The characters (aka champions) had an overall "cute" visual and the map was a lot simpler.
        </p>
        <p>Even though I consider the game to be a "bad" copy of DotA, it had its own fun. It could have also been due to the rising popularity of the game which meant you were able to always find a match.</p>
        <p>
          Similarly to DotA, each team consists of 5 players with unique roles but each side can pick the same champion which means there is always a possibility for a mirror match. 
          The concept was much alike, you would have carry roles and support roles who follow around the carries like pets.
        </p>
        <p>As I mentioned before, the map was a lot simpler in 3 main aspects, high-ground mechanic, environment interaction and open pathing.</p>
        <p>
          Firstly to talk about the absence of the high-ground mechanic, although the terrain may show some sort of slope or ground height difference, it doesn't give an advantage to the user standing on the high-ground.
          In DotA, there are two advantages of standing on high-ground, vision and the auto-attack miss chance coming from the lower ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly the only environment interaction that existed was the brushes which you could hide inside but still have vision of the outside, whereas the majority of the map in DotA is covered by interactable trees which can be
          broken or chopped but will regrow after a certain period of time. The reason why the destruction of trees is important (not in real life though) is because the trees obstruct vision which could lead to enemies escaping or
          juking between them using the fog-of-war. 
        </p>
        <p>Lastly, the paths in general are much more straightforward and wider without tiny spaces where you can sneak by or juke through.</p>
        <p>To close it off, if I were to name my favourite champions, it would have to be <span id="blitzcrank" className="shadow">Blitzcrank</span> and <span id="thresh" className="shadow">Thresh</span>.</p>

        <p>One of the most popular custom maps in Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos is DotA (Defense of the Ancients).</p>
        <p>Although there were a lot of custom maps where you play as one hero, they were never as fun as a game of DotA with your friends.</p>
        <p>Back then, I never really "explored" the game enough to understand how it worked and how complicated it was. I guess I just never bothered to read.</p>
        <p>
          As time passed, a small community of OCE players showed up in Garena and decided to play online. 
          Of course I never really won and it may sound like an excuse, but the servers weren't that stable so a lot of the players would disconnect in the middle of the game without being able to reconnect.
        </p>
        <p>To briefly explain how complex that game was, the amount of possibilities with different hero and item combinations were limitless, which meant that any player could learn something just from playing a game.</p>
        <p>Unlike the current games these days where you have a <span className="bold">META</span> that diminishes the majority of options the players/teams can make, the game can only be said as endless possibilities.</p>
        <p>In the end of the game's life, there were 110 heroes available to play and amongst all, <span id="earthshaker" className="shadow">Earthshaker - Raigor Stonehoof</span> was my pick.</p>

        <p>Maplestory is probably a game that doesn't really need an explanation or review as it's a game that most people would have tried at least once during their childhood.</p>
        <p>The game itself has a very friendly atmosphere, the art style and music has an appealing feeling to it (even now it's still great) and lastly the gameplay was fun and simple.</p>
        <p>Although it was a MMORPG, I never really got into power leveling my character but more so enjoyed the actual world and the community that I was part of.</p>
        <p>There definitely was a "phase" for everyone where they would get stuck into the game and even create fan artwork and animations of their own, like myself.</p>
        <p>Before all the new characters were released the game was actually considered "pretty hard" as the levelling was incredibly slow and had to grind like a maniac just like every other Korean MMORPG.</p>
        <p>Maplestory was definitely recognised as a great game, however as more pay-to-win and easier content got released the game hit a downfall.</p>
        <p>So many years have passed since I played, but my favourite classes are <span id="battle-mage" className="shadow">Battle Mage</span> and <span id="dawn-warrior" className="shadow">Dawn Warrior</span>.</p>

        <p>Starcraft was one of the very first games I have ever played as a kid.</p>
        <p>Being a game that was developed back in the 1990s, the graphics and the overall quality of the game was outstanding.</p>
        <p>
          The game offered a pretty lengthy single-player campaign which included the opportunity to play all three races, of course I ended up not completing the campaign for all three as I only favoured the almighty Terran<br />
          (The almighty part is indeed my own opinion).
        </p>
        <p>In the beginning, I only had one computer available between the whole family, so I never really was able to experience the multiplayer (no Battle.net account) and LAN side of the game, and I continued to keep playing against bots AKA computers.</p>
        <p>Eventually I got into multiplayer (LAN) and continuously battled my brother, however sometimes playing the game normally wasn't enough which then made us explore the custom map (AKA use map) side of Starcraft.</p>
        <p>The amount of player created custom maps available online were incredible, they all had different styles and mechanics to win the map. Another aspect of the custom maps were that the more players you had the more fun it would be.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, <span id="terran" className="shadow">Terran</span> will always be the master race.</p>
